Castaway Countdown is a top-down 2D survival and collection game built with Python and Pygame.

The main objective: collect all the planks while avoiding bouncing enemies and then escape the island!

You play as a character stranded on an island. To escape, you must collect all the wooden planks scattered around the map. Avoid the bouncing hunters â€” if they hit you, you fail the quest. After collecting all the necessary planks, reach the dock to win!

Timer: You only have limited time to complete the quest.
Collision Detection: Uses hitboxes for accurate collision with planks, enemies, and the dock.
